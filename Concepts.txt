||Dealing with Collisions||

Use an array to check whether an entity has the ability to collide with another
then use a listener to collide those entities.

Use quad-trees to do the broad part of the search, seems fairly efficient.

could also have a moving and non-moving collidable objects list for the event generator, such that the quad tree uses the moving ones to threshold creation of sub-nodes, might improve efficiency.

use either circle-hitboxes or, (mostly later?) Separating Axis Theorem for the narrow part of the search.
