NOTICE:
Currently on hiatus due to university commitments.

demo-01.jar is a JAR of the latest stable version for anyone interested.

It's essentially just a single triangle-shaped "Ship":
	that can be moved around the screen with the arrow-keys,
	and fires rainbow-coloured triangular bullets when the space-bar is held down.
	and takes damage from said bullets, eventually dying.

It's not very exciting, but it works.

To-do:
Try to do a simple JInput implementation.
Improve engine structure a little (e.g. move certain functionality of of entities and into the engine itself, such as collision response.
