||NOTE||
Perhaps I should stop assuming vectors are all immutable? IDK

Use matrices for Polygons, not just vectors

to check if the polygon is convex (we need this for the collision hitbox), I'm pretty sure, if for any set of 3 points that are connected, the middle point lies "outside" of a line between it's two neighbours, it's convex, all I need to do is work out how todefine "outside"
	there might be a better way to do it using matrices though

use a combo of rectangular hitboxes and quadtrees for the broad phase, and later Separating Axis Theorem for the narrow phase
