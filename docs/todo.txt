Immediate To Do:
- the "translate" function in the Cartesian vector class is technically just "add" and should be renamed accordingly
- move collision-reaction determination, etc to the engine
	Prevent duplication of entity reactions caused by references to each other.
- reconsider integer velocity usage (and therefore we have to reconsider using integer coordinates): the inconsistency in speed at various angles is too high for .
	possible solution
- re-factor the getOverflowDistance function into the Path class, and possibly to have a better name.
- complete the main state machine such that it includes: the main-menu screen/state, the main in-game state, and a credits state.
- impliment a pause-menu substate for the main in-game state (this will give insight on how sub-states should generally be done).
