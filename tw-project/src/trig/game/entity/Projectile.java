    //note: one reason /all/ projectiles might be destructible is that we'd probably want to limit the number of them that exist for lagg-stopping purposes, we might instead just do that for StBullet or something though, idk
    //note: some projectiles could still, concievably, refract or turn etc on collision?


    //should think about what properties all projectiles have, but that could maybe be done a bit later.
