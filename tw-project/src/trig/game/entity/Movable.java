    //Bullets would have a velocity and direction, but not all entities will move in simple straight lines, and those that don't should definitely use their own internal functions for updating their location.
    //In addition to this, it may be easier to implement collision events by having most objects responsible for their own movement?

    //QUESTION: WOULD IT ACTUALLY BE EASIER TO IMPLEMENT COLLISIONS THAT WAY OR NOT?

    //FURTHERMORE HOW SHOULD WE IMPLEMENT COLLISIONS? SHOULD THE GAME ENGINE DO IT OR ONLY MOVABLE ENTITIES?

    //NOTE: decided that it's unlikely that the Interface for movable objects would need direction, as it's unlikely that much else other than the actual entity itself will find the direction useful!

    //all movable entities have a collision event or handler? How should we construct this? //research

    /*
        if we want all entities to have a velocity, it implies that the server would handle latency by automatically updating the position as per current velocity,
        Which isn't a bad idea,
        but over what time period is velocity measured, etc?

    //since each object has their own draw method, which will draw the lines and stuff, do we actually need a direction for them all?
