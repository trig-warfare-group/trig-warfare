/**
 * A node-tree class that can be used to estimate collisions, where each node is an instance of this class
 * Has the following data:
 *  maximum number of objects a node can contain before it needs to split (constant)
 *  maximum number of levels the tree is allowed to contain (constant)
 *  the depth-level of the node
 *  a list of objects the node contains
 *  information about the region the node represents:
 *      height
 *      width
 *      corner (a small array[2] for the top-left corner of the region, used for making sub nodes)
 *      center (a small array[2] for the center of the region, used for determining which subnode an object would belong to, and possibly for creating the subnodes)
 *
 *
 *
 * Involves 5 basic operations:
 *  splitting the node into subnodes
 *  adding objects to the tree (and determining where it belongs)
 *  finding out which direct subnodes of a particular node an object would be to based on it's coordinates:
 *      this will be an array of integers, in case the object overlaps multiple nodes.
 *  receiving the objects within the tree that are in the same node as a particular object and therefore likely to collide.
 *  clearing all objects from a node and its subnodes. (In Java this is redundant due to the garbage collector, we'll either just clear the top one or create a new one every frame
 *
 * For my implimentation I am thinking of (BUT HAVEN'T YET) doing the following customisations on the basic algorithm:
 *  using a temporary wrapper object to store each object's node location in the tree, rather than re-searching each time:
 *      including which sub-nodes the object overlaps if this occurs
 *      it could possibly be created by the tree and returned?
